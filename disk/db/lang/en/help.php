Write it in a simple text of moderate length, with short sentences.

You can choose a different person from one day to the next. Some of your brothers systematically choose the archetypal image of Christ (Jesus) with whom they had no interaction during their lives. This is NOT effective, unless it bears true and intense devotion.

You have to observe a silence of 6 to 7 minutes to concentrate before asking, focusing deeply on that person, imagining that she is looking at you and is ready to listen to you.

Recite the text mentally, pronouncing the words slowly and clearly. Try to pronounce your sentences with a strong mental voice, as if you telepathically communicate with the deceased (this is an image, we hope you will understand the meaning).

You must have a true belief in the importance of your request because it is \"heard\" exactly how it is expressed. You must adopt the modest and humble posture of a suppliant asking a huge favor to the only person able to grant it to you.

You must finally observe the silence for 6 to 7 minutes, concentrating after the prayer by thanking and taking leave of the deceased.

You must repeat this prayer every day for seven consecutive days (no more, no less). It should not last more than twenty minutes every day.','en'],82=>['need auth','Required permission level','en'],83=>['model_app','Model App to decline
